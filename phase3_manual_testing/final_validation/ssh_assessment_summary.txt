=======================================

FINDINGS FROM PHASES 2 & 3:
1. Service Status: INCONSISTENT
   - Sometimes shows as 'open'  
   - Sometimes shows as 'filtered'
   - Indicates possible rate limiting or DDoS protection

2. Security Concerns:
   - Password authentication likely enabled
   - Service accessible from internet
   - Potential for brute force attacks

3. Business Risk: MEDIUM
   - Not primary attack vector
   - Infrastructure access if compromised
   - Secondary concern after Drupal vulnerabilities

RECOMMENDATION: 
- Implement key-based authentication only
- Consider restricting SSH access by IP
- Priority: Address after Drupal migration
